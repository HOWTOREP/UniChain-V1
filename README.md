# UniChain-V1
Bridging the gap of interoperability and addressing the shortcomings of your favorite L1's and 2’s. Web3 much like the early internet is fragmented 
into a number of small islands that separate pockets of users and use cases. Unichain seeks to address this through a Bitcoin Lightning like approach 
building out sublayers for L1’s and L2’s that acts as a superhighway for value, just as the WWW did for the Internet. The first use case for this new layer 
is our native multi chain DEX allowing for the first time in Web3 a DEX experience where you can trade across multiple ecosystems in one UI without needing to bridge. 
For the Starknet House we plan to focus one finalizing our BD plans, sorting our Airdrop logistics, and start work on a Starknet - Solana - Ethereum MVP
